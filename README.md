# This project focuses on optimizing improved heat transfer for water heating using ultrasonic stimulation. The goal is to enhance the efficiency of water heaters.

Reproducibility Notes:
----------
- The results of experimental intuition on the number of transducers (Fig. 12) are obtained using both numerical and experimental results under slightly different conditions, consistent with the core trends.
- Details of the optimization results (Table 6) for the configuration ID = 1 are compared with the closest experimental results concerning U.P., H.h., H.P., and Q/Î”T.
